I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. 
I was previously a postdoctoral fellow in the [Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center](https://www.ericandwendyschmidtcenter.org/) 
at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). 
I received my PhD in Computer Science from [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) 
where I was fortunate to be advised by [Ben Raphael](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~braphael/).

My research focuses on developing computational methods for addressing fundamental problems in biology. I am particularly excited about developing spatiotemporal and graph-based ML algorithms for new biological technologies.
