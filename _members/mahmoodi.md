description: "
Evanjelin is a Computer Science PhD student working with Professors Harold Pimentel and Sriram Sankararaman. She graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2021 with majors in Computer Science and Mathematics. After her undergrad, she did a research internship at the NIH where she discovered her interests in computational biology which led her to UCLA for her PhD. For her research, Evanjelin is interested in statistical modeling to find the genetic causes of disease. Outside of school, Evanjelin likes doing (reformer) Pilates and hitting 10K steps a day (OK, she tries), NYTimes Games (better than Sandy), and wearing noise-cancelling headphones to (try to) keep herself from getting distracted by everyone in lab.
