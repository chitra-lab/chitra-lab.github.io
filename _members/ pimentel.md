description: "
Harold started as an assistant professor in Computational Medicine and Human Genetics at UCLA in July 2020. Previously,he was a postdoctoral researcher in [Jonathan Pritchardâ€™s lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html) at Stanford.

Broadly, he is interested in understanding how genes work in concert through gene regulation to make our bodies function normally. Part of why he finds this area so fascinating is the technology is constantly evolving, as are the questions from both the biological side and the modeling side. As the theory evolves, in parallel the technology evolves opening new questions."
