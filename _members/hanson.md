description: Chloe completed a B.S. in Environmental Science and a M.S. in Integrative Biology at Oregon State University (advised by Dr. Molly K. Burke). Her master's thesis research focused on revealing the genetics and evolutionary dynamics of Roundup resistance in model system S. cerevisiae. Currently, in the Pimentel lab, Chloe is building statistical models for analyzing Cell Village data in collaboration with Dr. Michael Wells, UCLA Department of Human Genetics. She is broadly interested in investigating how the genome regulates physiological processes and how these regulatory pathways might be targeted to treat disease. Outside of the lab Chloe enjoys biking, eating and exploring the Sierra!
