description: "Jerome joined the Bioinformatics PhD program after doing undergrad at UChicago in Computer Science and Statistics. He is interested in building models that leverage experimentally induced and natural genetic variation to better understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of human traits and disease. Outside of research, he enjoys reading, taking pictures, and disappointing the duolingo owl."
