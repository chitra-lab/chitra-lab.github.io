description: "Albert is a PhD student co-advised by Sriram Sankararaman. He did his undergrad at Duke in Math & Computer Science, and after graduation fled West to seek his fortune. Albert is interested in developing methods to understand gene regulation and functional genomics. Outside of work, Albert can be found playing chess, distracting other lab members, and staring at the ceiling. Unfortunately, this is often true during work too."
