### Graduate students

----------------------

Graduate students in our lab will be on collaborative teams with the goal of building generalizable software to solve complex problems in genomics.
The goal and expectation is for each student to graduate with expertise in modeling and data analysis as well as expertise in an area of functional genomics.

We take UCLA students from [Biomathematics](https://compmed.ucla.edu/biomathematics-graduate-programs), [Bioinformatics](https://bioinformatics.ucla.edu/), [Genetics and Genomics](https://bioscience.ucla.edu/home-areas/genetics-genomics/), [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/), and related programs.

The students we expect will thrive in our lab come from diverse backgrounds but are not limited to:

- students coming in with strong quantitative backgrounds interested in building models and software.
- students coming in with mixed backgrounds (e.g. quantitative biology) interested in analyzing complicated data sets with specific biological questions in mind.
- experimental students who are primarily advised by another principal investigator, but want a computational component in their dissertation.

**If you think you might be a good fit** and are already at UCLA, please send Harold an email with your CV and research interests.

### Postdoctoral researchers

----------------------

We currently have a position open jointly with Bogdan Pasaniuc. The job ad is [here](https://pimentellab.com/files/pimentel_pasaniuc_postdoc.pdf).

<!--
> We have funding for and plan to take one postdoctoral researcher starting as early as January 2021.
> If you plan to be primarily advised by us, we expect candidates to have a track record of software development, computational modeling, and data analysis.
//-->

We are also open to co-advising postdoctoral researchers with other computational or experimental labs.
An example might be an experimental postdoc with their own biological question for which there are no current analysis tools.

If interested, please send the following to Harold:

- a short research statement on your goals
- your CV
- contact information for three references

### Undergraduate students

----------------------

Unfortunately we are currently at capacity for undergrads.
However, if you think that you might want to do some work in the lab in the future, please reach out so we can discuss.

[comment]: <> (We plan to take undergraduate students who have at least some programming experience.)
[comment]: <> (Given the short nature of undergraduate research, most undergraduates in our group will likely be working on genomic data modeling and software of existing experimental protocols.)
[comment]: <> (However, there are always exceptions.)
[comment]: <> (If this sounds appealing, please email Harold your CV and a list of relevant courses you've taken.)

### Summer undergraduate students

----------------------

UCLA sponsors [B.I.G. Summer](https://qcb.ucla.edu/big-summer/) every year, a 8-week paid summer research internship.
Please [click here](https://qcb.ucla.edu/big-summer/) for more information.

### Research assistants / other

----------------------

We don't have immediate plans to hire in other areas but if you think you are an exceptional fit, please email Harold your CV along with a short description of what you hope to accomplish by joining the lab.
