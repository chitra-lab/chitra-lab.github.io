# Interested in joining?

----------------------

I am actively recruiting motivated students with strong mathematical ability and/or coding skills. Research experience in biology is not necessary, but one should be willing to learn new biological concepts as required.
 
## PhD and Master's students

*Current JHU PhD and Master's students.* If you are a current or incoming PhD or Master's student at JHU in CS, BME, AMS, or a related department, I would be very happy to talk about potential opportunities in the lab. Please reach out to me via [email](uthsav@jhu.edu) with:
* a brief description of who you are and your research interests,
* your CV, and
* any other relevant information (e.g. past projects, coursework/transcripts, etc).

This information will allow me to assess your fit in the lab and suggest potential research projects. If there is a good fit, then I will schedule a time to meet.

*Prospective PhD and Master's students.* I recruit students through the JHU [Computer Science PhD program](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/graduate-studies/phd-program/phd-program-admissions/) and [Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/academic-programs/graduate-studies/mse-programs/). Please consult the program websites for further details and mention me (**Uthsav Chitra**) in your application. Please note that I am highly unlikely to respond to emails from prospective students who have not yet been admitted.


## Postdoctoral researchers

If you are interested in joining the lab as a post-doc, I would be very happy to talk. Please reach out to me via [email](uthsav@jhu.edu) with your CV, a brief description of your research interests and past work, and contact information for 1-3 references. Prospective applicants are also encouraged to apply to the [DSAI postdoctoral fellowship](https://ai.jhu.edu/careers/postdoctoral-fellowship-program/).

## JHU undergraduate students

I am quite happy to work with motivated and curious JHU undergraduate students. If you are interested, please reach out to me via [email](uthsav@jhu.edu) with the following information:
* your year and major,
* your transcript with classes that you have taken or are taking in computer science, applied math, statistics, computational biology, etc.,
* any prior research experience and the supervising faculty member,
* your expected time commitment (hours per week),
* a brief description of why you are interested in the lab and your long-term goals,
* when you would like to work (e.g. summer, during semester), and
* any other relevant information (e.g. website).

This information will allow me to assess your fit in the lab and help match you to a relevant research project. If there is a good fit, then I will schedule a time to meet.

I require a **substantial time commitment from undergraduates** in my lab, so please only reach out if you truly have the time and motivation. Many of the undergraduate students I have mentored have won research awards (thesis prize, NSF GRFP, MIT poster award) and have published papers in top venues (e.g. [ICML 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07878), [RECOMB 2022/Cell Systems 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.05.479261v1), [RECOMB 2024/Nature Methods 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02503-3)).

## Others (e.g. visiting students, summer interns)

I may be able to host interns or visiting students on an *ad hoc* basis. If you are motivated and have strong interests or past experience in computational biology or machine learning, please reach out to me via [email](uthsav@jhu.edu) with your CV, a brief description of your research interests, and why you specifically want to join our lab.
