# Welcome to the Pimentel Lab!

<br>

We aim to understand gene regulation by building broadly applicable computational tools to analyze high-throughput genomic assays. This approach works by carefully investigating the experimental design and developing data-driven models using computer science and high-dimensional statistics to advance biomedical discovery.
